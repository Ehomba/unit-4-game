Star wars rpg game

You choose a character, Then choose an enemy!

As you attack your attack power grows but your health, and your enemy's health, goes down!

Have Fun!!!

The problem: Having responsive elements that reacted to their health, having the elements move to the necessary spot at the correct time, and have the element go away at the correct time.

Solution: Creative "if" functions solved most of the most pressing problems with moving elements at the correct time and having them dissappear. I also had some bugs that were appearing when certain elements (like the attack button) were available before they were relevant, I took the easy solution and just hid these elements until they were ready to be used.
